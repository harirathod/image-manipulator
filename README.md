In its current state, it can:
  - Convert images to greyscale and sepia
  - Display images in windows
  - Save images to file
  - _SOON: Convert images to ASCII art_

## Purpose of Project

The project was created alongside my studies of Year 1 Computer Science.

This project demonstrates my continued learning of programming principles, including:
- MongoDB Atlas
- Java Concurrency
- File I/O
- Exception Handling
- JUnit testing
- Responsibility-driven design
- Cohesion & Coupling
- Maintainability

## Using the Project Yourself

###### _Paste the following commands into your terminal._

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/harirathod/cinema-booking-application.git
```

2. Start the application with the following command:
```py
java -jar cinema-booking-application/out/artifacts/cinema_jar/cinema.jar
```
> **Note:** Please make sure you have the JDK (Java Development Kit) installed.

And you're done! You can now try out the cinema booking application via the terminal!

## How the Project Works

(As of now), the main method of class **com.cinema.cinema.SetUpDatabase** creates some Screens and writes them to a file "screens.ser".

When the main method of class **com.cinema.cinema.Main** is run to start the cinema booking application, and the Screens in "screens.ser" are loaded into the application.

Any tickets booked by the user are written to "tickets.ser", so are stored persistently. These tickets can be viewed with the 'basket' command.
